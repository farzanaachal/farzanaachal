🌸 Hi there! I’m an aspiring law student who’s just a little curious about code 👩🏻‍⚖️💻  
I studied Political Science & Sociology 🎓 and love exploring how tech & justice can connect.

🌼 Currently learning: anything that helps make legal stuff more human-friendly  
📚 I love reading, visiting museums 🖼️, and taking too many pictures 📷 of flowers, cats, and pretty landscapes

🐣 Still a beginner — but excited to learn, build, and share 🌟
